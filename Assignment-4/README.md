### Quick Instructions
- The front end code runs on port 3000, backend on 8000.
- cd into both frond end and back end, run npm install and then npm run start
- Go to localhost:3000 and start making requests using the search bar! :D
- The zip code and location doesn't show because the ip address is ::1 when on localhost but you can replace the .env with what you want.
